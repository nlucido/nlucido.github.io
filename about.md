Born & raised Texan, husband, father, motorsports lover, and Data Scientist. I am a seasoned client-facing executive with a passion for turning data into meaningful insights to solve complex problems. As a kid, I was always the one asking why, why, and why is that? Still asking the whys and being an analytical problem-solver at heart, I have discovered how data can be an incredible tool for addressing the uncertain.

This journey of mine is fueled by the ever-evolving world of Data Science and the amazing connections I’m making along the way. By leveraging my strong interpersonal and technical skill sets, I look forward to solving the future’s challenges with the power of data driven solutions.
